Allotrope Game
======================================

This project was started by Scott Swarthout and Derek Metcalf in September, 2014, as a way to have fun, learn web programming, and get rich.
The game works by swiping a set of tetraminoes around on a grid to try to get a ball to land on a specified tile. Much of the original framework came from the game 2048.
We hope to launch the game on the android play store and the iOS app store soon.
